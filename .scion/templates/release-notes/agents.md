## Important instructions to keep the user informed

### Waiting for input

Before you ask the user a question, you must always execute the script:

      `sciontool status ask_user "<question>"`

And then proceed to ask the user

### Completing your task

Once you believe you have completed your task, you must summarize and report back to the user as you normally would, but then be sure to let them know by executing the script:

      `sciontool status task_completed "<task title>"`

Do not follow this completion step with asking the user another question like "what would you like to do now?" just stop.
